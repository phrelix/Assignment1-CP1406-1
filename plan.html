    <t>Content Analysis</t>
    <p>Most of the pages will contain images and a little bit of words or sentences but the about us will contain some of the juicy bits. As for the content of most of these pages it will include nothing but images and quotes with a bit of pricing. This page will not have that much written content on select pages.</p>

    <t>Images</t>
    <p>The images will be located in menu an special for the varying types in organized menu fashion as to avoid just a regular list, it will be changed depending on the size of the images and will be neatly alligned</p>

    <t>Page design</t>
    <p>The page will have the same navbar and footer an only a varying body section, in the case of home and specials it will change from having a description and announcements or comments to a select few discounts, but for the most part the pages will look the same.</p>

    <t>Font and style guide</t>
    <p>In case of fonts I will be using, the cookie font. https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cookie</p>

    <t>Project timeline </t>
    <p>This project should not take too long, once the navbar and footer are designed they will remain constant on most pages, and the theme wont change too much, will keep the theme simple with a bit of coloring an inovative designs for some of the images and texts</p>

    <t>Budget</t>
    <p>Depending on the domain bought most of the domains besides the org and such, which means it wouldnt profit or are generally implied. The possible range you could have to make would vary and could increase by quite a bit. However, the hosting will be much cheaper since this won't be a heavily serviced website, people will log on and log off so it shouldnt cost as much.</p>
